## 🌸 My Story: From Non-Tech to Tech 

**Plot twist:** A semester ago, I had *mini* coding experience. Like, just `basic syntax` 🙈

I started my college journey as a **Math major** — a completely different path. But something kept pulling me toward tech. In 2024, while still in my math track, I decided to try a Machine Learning internship just to explore different path and find something fun. Little did I know, that internship would become my **first stepping stone** into this whole new world. 🌱

That experience lit a little spark in me. I fell in love with building things, solving real problems with data, and seeing models actually *work*. So I took a deep breath and made the scariest decision of my life — **I switched to Data Science & AI**.

That was just **one semester ago**. 

Since then? It's been a wild, beautiful, sometimes-frustrating-but-always-rewarding ride! 🎢 I went from barely knowing what a for loop was to building ML pipelines, doing research, and even teaching other students Python. 

This journey taught me that it's **never too late** to start something new. You don't need to be a childhood coding prodigy to make it in tech. You just need curiosity, determination, and a whole lot of coffee ☕✨

## 🌟 A Little About Me

I'm someone who believes data tells stories that can change the world! 📊💡

I love turning messy datasets into meaningful insights, building ML models that actually *work*, and making pretty visualizations that even non-tech people can understand. My approach? **Clean code, clear storytelling, and lots of passion.**

When I'm not coding, you can probably find me exploring Miami's food scene 🍜, binge-watching shows, or dreaming about my next project idea!

## 🧪 What I've Been Up To

### 🔬 Undergraduate Research Assistant — SOLID Lab @ FIU
Working on **blockchain + federated learning** for smart parking privacy! Built reputation-based client filtering systems to make AI more secure and trustworthy. Research life is hard but so rewarding! 🔐

### 🎧 Data Analytics Extern — Beats by Dre
Got to analyze Gen Z consumer behavior using Python and Power BI. Turning messy survey data into insights that help real product decisions? *Chef's kiss* 👨‍🍳💋

### ⚙️ Machine Learning Intern — TC Shipping (Vietnam)
Built anomaly detection pipelines on 100K+ records! Reduced false alerts by 18% and predicted equipment issues 3-7 days early. My models actually saved money! 💸

### 👩‍🏫 Teaching Assistant — COP 3045 @ FIU
Teaching Python and OOP to 40+ students. Honestly, explaining concepts to others helped ME understand them better too. Teaching is learning! 📚
